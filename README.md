# sftp

SFTP client for golang

This is a work in progress, just something that I need at the moment.

It is based on an article at http://www.inanzzz.com/index.php/post/tjp9/golang-sftp-client-server-example-to-upload-and-download-files-over-ssh-connection-streaming

I added the UploadFile and UploadIfNew methods.
